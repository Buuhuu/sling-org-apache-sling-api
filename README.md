# Apache Sling API

This module is part of the [Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org) project.

The Sling API defines an extension to the Servlet API 3.0 to
provide access to content and unified access to request
parameters hiding the differences between the different methods
of transferring parameters from client to server. Note that the
Sling API bundle does not include the Servlet API but instead
requires the API to be provided by the Servlet container in
which the Sling framework is running or by another bundle.
